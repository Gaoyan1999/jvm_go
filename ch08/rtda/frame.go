A frame is used to store data and partial results, as well as to perform dynamic linking, return values for methods, and dispatch exceptions.
A new frame is created each time a method is invoked.
A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes,
whether that completion is normal or abrupt (it throws an uncaught exception).
Frames are allocated from the Java Virtual Machine stack (ยง2.5.2) of the thread creating the frame.
Each frame has its own array of local variables (ยง2.6.1), its own operand stack (ยง2.6.2),
and a reference to the run-time constant pool (ยง2.5.5) of the class of the current method.
